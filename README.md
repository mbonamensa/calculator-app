## My process

### Built with

- React commponents, props, useState
- SASS

### What I learned

I practiced updating state and using conditional rendering to display components and elements. I also learned about the JavaScript `eval()` that helps you compute strings.
This is not a recommended way of running computations. This project is solely for practice purposes.


### Continued development

I'd want to learn about better ways of running calculations instead of using `eval()`


### Useful resources

These resources were useful in helping me build this project

- [JavaScript Eval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval)
